CRITICAL WARNING: [Common 17-1649] The Vivado message database '/scratch_ssd/ms/tapwork_scoooter/compose/axi4mm/AU280/scoooter_pe/001/170.0/microarch/microarch.runs/synth_1/vivado.pb' contains 22103 messages. Restoring all messages from this message database will impact Vivado performance, so only WARNING, CRITICAL WARNING, and ERROR messages will be restored.
